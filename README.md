# Custom New Tab Startpage for Google Chrome

A simple Google Chrome startpage I wrote to replace the standard new tab page.

It is written in pure HTML/CSS/JS and uses no libraries.

## Features

- Welcome back message
- Clock, with time in 24 hr format and date in day month year format
- Google search bar
- Links to my most visited websites with a little animation for improved interactivity
- Responsiveness on mobile screens (not that I use this on mobile, but it's nice to do anyway)

The master branch contains the files for Google Chrome but there is also a Firefox branch for, well... Firefox
