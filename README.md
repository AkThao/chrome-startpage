# Custom New Tab Startpage for Google Chrome

A simple Google Chrome startpage I wrote to replace the standard new tab page.

It is written in pure HTML/CSS/JS and uses no libraries.

## Features

- Welcome back message
- Clock, with time in 24 hr format and date in day month year format
- Links to my most visited websites with a little animation for improved interactivity

## Todo

- Add blinking animation to prompt ">" in welcome message
- Improve mobile responsiveness
